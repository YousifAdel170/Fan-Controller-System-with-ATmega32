# Fan Controller System with ATmega32

## This project implements a temperature-controlled fan system using the ATmega32 microcontroller. The fan's state is automatically adjusted based on the temperature read by an LM35 temperature sensor. The system also uses an LCD to display the current temperature and fan status, and PWM is utilized to control the fan speed.

## Features

### Temperature Sensing:

#### The LM35 sensor provides analog output, converted to digital values using the ADC.

### Fan Control:

#### The fan state is controlled based on temperature thresholds:

##### < 30°C: Turn off the fan.

##### ≥ 30°C: Fan at 25% speed.

##### ≥ 60°C: Fan at 50% speed.

##### ≥ 90°C: Fan at 75% speed.

##### ≥ 120°C: Fan at 100% speed.

### PWM Fan Speed Control:

#### Fan speed is regulated using a PWM signal generated by Timer0.

### LCD Display:

#### Displays the current temperature and fan state.

## System Architecture

### The system is designed based on a layered architecture model and includes the following drivers:

#### ADC Driver:

##### Configures the ADC to convert the analog temperature signal to digital values.

#### GPIO Driver:

##### Controls input/output pins for the LCD and fan.

#### LCD Driver:

##### Manages communication with the LCD to display data.

#### Temperature Sensor Driver:

##### Handles communication with the LM35 sensor.

#### DC Motor Driver:

##### Controls the fan motor, including its rotation and speed.

#### PWM Driver:

##### Controls the fan motor speed using PWM signals.

## How It Works

### The LM35 temperature sensor continuously provides temperature readings.

### The ATmega32 microcontroller reads these values via the ADC, converts the values to temperature, and determines the fan state.

### The fan is controlled by adjusting the motor speed using PWM based on predefined temperature thresholds.

### The LCD displays the current temperature and the fan status.
